# Binary Treeees
First time I whished I'm doing something in c++. 

Tbh I spent more time looking at examples on net than trying to do it myself, needed some time to understand what's going on here :D

When i finaly understood that almost everything in ruby IS "pointer" to object and how to refer to them, I made scrappy version of tree and bfs/dfs search methods.

### TODO:
- return here and probably do all over from scratch
